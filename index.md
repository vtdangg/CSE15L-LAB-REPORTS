# How to Stay Hydrated

## Dehydration Prevention
If you find yourself thirsty, that could mean that you're already dehydrated. The key is to think of prevention a day ahead. If you drink a good amount of water at least *1 day ahead*, that is a good way to make sure you stay hydrated the next day. 

For example, if you have a race tomorrow, you shouldn't start drinking tons of water the day of the race. You should start drinking a good amount of water before, or you could be in risk of dehydration.

Drinking water even when you're not thirsty or if it's a chilly day is still **essential** and quite easy to forget.

System.out.print("Hello World!");
System.out.print("Stay hydrated!");

Have a great rest of your day!
